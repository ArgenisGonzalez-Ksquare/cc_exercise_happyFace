# Let's do some exercises!

Welcome! This repo contains all the information you need to complete __exercise-name__ aswell as some helpful tips and commands

# As student, what do I need to do?

## Fork this repo
The first thing you need to do is create a Fork of this repo, this allows you to create an exact copy of what is in here thus creating a development environment for you.

If you don't know how to fork please refer to this documentation: [https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo] Fork a repo@Github.com

## Clone the fork of your repo
Forking a repo only creates a copy in your GitHub account not on your computer so the next step is to do just that.
Clone the repo as you already know and if you don't remember how, please refer to this documentation: [https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository](Clone a forked repo@Github.com)

## Install packages
Now we just install the packages by running this command 
```bash
$ npm ci
```



## Do your thing
After all that work the only thing that remains is for you to complete the exercise. To that cause you will find a seed code inside of __exercise.js__ file. Please pay close attention to the comments inside this code.

Also I'd gladly remaind you to never change the name of the functions or the tests won't run and you will have a pretty disastrous grade at the end.

You can always test if your solution will be valid by running the following command:
```bash
$ npm test
```

## Deliverable
Refer to the moodle assignment for this part.

## Happy Coding! :school:
